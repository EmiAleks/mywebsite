However, relatively recent studies show that not only can severe stress impact genetics, its effects can even last throughout multiple generations, even when the original stressor is long gone. This literature review dives into the studies that prove that parental stress can impact the genetic makeup of their offspring.\nRead the literature review here!"

    "text": "Hello! My name is Emi, and I am currently working as the Administrative Assistant at UMass Amherst Math and Stats Department. I am passionate about psycholinguistics and data analysis! Research on multilingualism has a special place in my heart.\n\n\nLinguistics and Cognitive Sciences in general are incredibly fascinating; however, the unfortunate reality is that a good chunk of linguistics was studied on monolingual speakers, or even more specifically, monolingual English speakers. This means that the multilingual mind is still largely understudied, and there could be linguistic knowledge that cannot quite be applied to the many multilinguals of the globe. I wish to contribute more information about multilingualism to the field of psycholinguistics.\n\n\n\nIn 2024, I earned my Dual Bachelor’s Degree in Linguistics and Psychology from University of Massachusetts Amherst. I graduated from the UMass Commonwealth Honors College with the International Scholars Certificate.\n\n\n\nCurrently, I am assisting the Mathematics and Statistics Department with a variety of needs – administrative, financial, technological, and data-related. Previously, I had worked for the Speech, Language and Hearing Sciences Department as a Research Recruiter and Coordinator. I had also been a Research Assistant at the NCAP Lab in the Psychology Department, where I completed my honors thesis on phonological error comprehension in monolingual and multilingual participants. Additionally, I spent time at the Computational Sentence Processing Lab in the UMass Linguistics Department, the marketing team at Language Connections in Brighton, and the Sleep and Circadian Rhythms Data Analysis team at Brigham and Womens Hospital in Boston.\nCheck out my CV to learn more about my professional experiences!\nThanks for checking out my website!"
